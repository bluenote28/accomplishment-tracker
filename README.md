This is an internal project I did at Amazon. I have permission to share pictures but cannot show code. This app allows you to keep track of your accomplishments done at work. You can also publish any certifications you have obtained to show to your manager.
The manager can then view their employee's accomplishments, verify any accomplishments that they personally have awareness of so any future managers can know their accomplishments are authentic. They also can set goals for their employees to achieve. 

This app is built on AWS and utilizes lambda functions, dynamodb, and API gateway. 

The front end is writtern in React. The backend is written in Python, and the CDK package is written in Typescript.
